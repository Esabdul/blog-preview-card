## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I practiced:

- Writing clean and semantic HTML
- Creating a responsive card layout using Flexbox
- Using hover/focus states for better user interaction
- Maintaining consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

#### Example code I'm proud of:

```css
.card-title:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Practice using `:focus-visible` for better accessibility
- Explore combining Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Refine responsive design skills for more complex layouts
